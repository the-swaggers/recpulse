# Description

This project aims to create a new machine learning framework. Initially the goal was to learn build a framework for fun and to implement weird ideas for some models, to which I haven't got. Currently my main goal is to deeply understand how the large frameworks like PyTorch, JAX and TF work. 

The current stage is the implementation of the low level backend of the project with the aim at a torch like behavior on the python side later.
