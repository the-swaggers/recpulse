### Description

This project is created to make a framework for machine learning. The main task is rather not to overcome already existent ones such as tf, sklearn and torch, but to gain experience creating something similar.

Here are the features that will be implemented (not all at once and not necessarily in the following order):

  * numpy based sequential API with dense layers
  * optimization algorithms
  * new layers
  * low-level operations (switch from numpy to custom code on either C or C++)
  * Impulse neural network with new class for this
  * .ipynb documentation
  * example models built with this API

This list is yet incomplete, but contains all the main ideas.
